  # Introduction
  The Incus team is pleased to announce the release of Incus 6.12!

  This release comes with some very long awaited improvements such as online growth of virtual machine memory, network address sets for easier network ACLs, revamped logging support and more!

  On top of the new features, this release also features quite a few welcome performance improvements, especially for systems with a lot of snapshots and with extra performance enhancements for those using ZFS.

  As usual, you can try it for yourself online: https://linuxcontainers.org/incus/try-it/

  Enjoy!

  # New features
  ## Network address sets
  To simplify management of complex network ACL rules, Incus now has support for address sets.

  Address sets are tied to projects similarly to ACLs and each set can contain a variety of IPv4 and IPv6 addresses. Sets can then be referenced from within ACLs for either the source or destination field.

      stgraber@dakara:~$ incus network address-set create cloudflare-dns
      Network address set cloudflare-dns created
      stgraber@dakara:~$ incus network address-set add cloudflare-dns 1.0.0.1
      stgraber@dakara:~$ incus network address-set add cloudflare-dns 1.1.1.1
      stgraber@dakara:~$ incus network address-set add cloudflare-dns 2606:4700:4700::1001
      stgraber@dakara:~$ incus network address-set add cloudflare-dns 2606:4700:4700::1111
      
      stgraber@dakara:~$ incus network acl create my-acl
      Network ACL my-acl created
      stgraber@dakara:~$ incus network acl rule add my-acl egress action=allow state=enabled
      stgraber@dakara:~$ incus network acl rule add my-acl egress action=reject state=enabled destination='$cloudflare-dns'
      
      stgraber@dakara:~$ incus config device override d13 eth0 security.acls=my-acl
      Device eth0 overridden for d13

      stgraber@dakara:~$ incus exec d13 -- ping linuxcontainers.org -c1 -W1
      PING linuxcontainers.org (2602:fc62:a:1::7) 56 data bytes

  ## Memory hotplug support in VMs
  One of the very few remaining gaps between the container and VM experience under Incus was that memory could only be reduced in a VM and never grown.

  This has now been fixed as we now support hotplugging memory into a guest, allowing for `limits.memory` to be increased at runtime, making that memory instantly available inside of the VM.

      stgraber@dakara:~$ incus launch images:debian/13 d13 --vm
      Launching d13
      stgraber@dakara:~$ incus exec d13 -- free -m
                     total        used        free      shared  buff/cache   available
      Mem:             879         238         662          19         102         640
      Swap:              0           0           0
      stgraber@dakara:~$ incus config set d13 limits.memory=4GiB
      stgraber@dakara:~$ incus exec d13 -- free -m
                     total        used        free      shared  buff/cache   available
      Mem:            3951         351        3684          19         102        3600
      Swap:              0           0           0

  ## Reworked logging handling & remote syslog
  Incus logging has so far been limited to two options:

   - Local syslog logging
   - Remote Loki logging (with a single endpoint)

  That's now changing with this release as we've rolled out a new much more flexible logging mechanism which allows for an unlimited number of logging targets which can either be `loki` or `syslog` and with support for selecting what events to include.

  Example:

      logging.loki01.target.type: loki
      logging.loki01.target.address: https://loki01.int.example.net
      logging.loki01.target.username: foo
      logging.loki01.target.password: bar
      logging.loki01.types: lifecycle,network-acl
      logging.loki01.lifecycle.types: instance

      logging.syslog01.target.type: syslog
      logging.syslog01.target.address: syslog01.int.example.net
      logging.syslog01.target.facility: security
      logging.syslog01.types: logging
      logging.syslog01.logging.level: warning

  This example defines two logging targets, `loki01` and `syslog01`, with the former receiving Loki logging traffic through an authenticated endpoint (reverse proxy) and only sends lifecycle events (specifically those affecting instances) as well as network ACL hits. The latter uses syslog logging and sends logging messages of priority warning or higher.

  ## SNAT support on complex network forwards
  Network forwards can be pretty flexible in how ports and port ranges are allowed.
  For example, you can forward port `80` and `443` externally to an internal IP on port `1234` and `2345` respectively.

  This works fine in most cases, but in specific situations, such as WebRTC applications using UDP ports, some of the traffic will be initiated from the instance rather than from an external client. In this scenario, traffic coming out of the instance from port `2345` should appear externally as coming from the forward address and port `443`.

  This is what the new `snat` property on individual ports within a network forward is here for. It sets up a matching SNAT rule for traffic originating from the instance.

  The feature is limited to network forwards on regular bridges (not OVN) and only on systems using `nftables` for firewalling.

  Documentation: https://linuxcontainers.org/incus/docs/main/howto/network_forwards/#port-properties

  ## Authentication through access_token parameter
  Incus supports two main authentication mechanisms:

   - TLS client certificates
   - OpenID Connect (OIDC)

  For the former, most clients will directly consume the TLS client certificate and use it as part of the TLS connection. However this doesn't always work, either because it's difficult for the client to handle (e.g. web browsers) or because of a TLS terminating proxy getting in the way.

  For this reason, we also support deriving a signed `Bearer` token from the TLS certificate and feeding that through the HTTP `Authorization` header.

  Now with this release, that same `Bearer` token can be passed through the `access_token` URL parameter rather than through the HTTP header.

  The primary reason for this is to allow connecting to authenticated websocket endpoints from web clients as the Javascript websocket API doesn't allow passing custom HTTP headers.

  Example:

      stgraber@dakara:~$ curl -k -s https://127.0.0.1:8443/1.0 | jq -r .metadata.auth
      untrusted
      stgraber@dakara:~$ curl -k -s https://127.0.0.1:8443/1.0?access_token=eyJhbGciOiJFUzM4NCIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzdWIiOiJhZjQ3MzRhYzY3YzAzMDYxY2Y1Yzg5Y2UxYTQ2NDAwYjc4MzQ2MWRiOGI3MjlkMDhjNDZhYjE5MmM3ZDc2NTMxIiwiZXhwIjoxNzQ1NTMxOTA4LCJuYmYiOjE3NDU1MzE4NDgsImlhdCI6MTc0NTUzMTg0OH0.WcsG48XQ41fNhLUlf-nqwAyJrZKpCrfM-W8mOSNpt7cwPH-QhKZkiBDa3sFWIVOdo15_cOZBeNy1QbJu6rCnYYQ18LpNJNkSKPkcwi65-yBo7U7ync5BQCuhsOgxAQap | jq -r .metadata.auth
      trusted

  ## Improved server side filtering in the CLI
  We've recently added support for server-side filtering of everything single object type within the Incus API. Following that, we're now slowly adding support for it to the CLI, allowing for less database and network traffic when only some specific items are requested.

  With this release, the following have now been fully ported to server-side filtering:

   - Instances
   - Images
   - Custom volumes
   - Profiles

  Example:

      stgraber@dakara:~$ incus profile list description=bar
      +------+-------------+---------+
      | NAME | DESCRIPTION | USED BY |
      +------+-------------+---------+
      | foo  | bar         | 0       |
      +------+-------------+---------+

  This work was partly done by students at the University of Texas in Austin.

  ## More generated documentation
  We've continued our effort to port most of our configuration tables to be generated directly from the code, avoiding any risk of forgotten configuration keys.

  With this release, the following are now extracted directly from the code:

   - Network bridges
   - Network forwards
   - TPM devices
   - Proxy devices
   - GPU devices
   - NIC devices
   - Infiniband devices

  This work was done by students at the University of Texas in Austin.
