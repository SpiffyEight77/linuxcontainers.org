  # Introduction
  The Incus team is pleased to announce the release of Incus 6.11!

  Without a doubt, the headline feature for this release is initial support for Linstor as a new storage driver for those looking for an alternative to Ceph!
  But that's far from all that this Incus release brings to the table. It also comes with a lot of new VM, OCI and networking features!

  As usual, you can try it for yourself online: https://linuxcontainers.org/incus/try-it/

  Enjoy!

  # New features
  ## Linstor storage driver
  Incus now supports Linstor as an alternative to Ceph for clustered storage.
  You can read more about Linstor itself on their website: https://linbit.com/linstor/

  In short, Linstor is a managed layer on top of Linux's DRBD mechanism which is used for block device replication between multiple servers.

  This allows for block volumes to be generated for containers and virtual machines with typically the primary copy existing on the server running the instance itself and a replica existing on another server in the cluster.

  Driver documentation: https://linuxcontainers.org/incus/docs/main/reference/storage_linstor/
  Howto: https://linuxcontainers.org/incus/docs/main/howto/storage_linstor_setup/
  Internals: https://linuxcontainers.org/incus/docs/main/reference/storage_linstor_internals/

  ## New MAC address range
  Both LXC and Incus have been using the `00:16:3e` MAC address range.

  This range comes from the Xen project allocation and while there's no risk of clashing with a real physical device MAC, it's had the downside of not allowing for easy distinguishing between LXC/Incus instances and those running on Xen.

  To make things cleaner moving forward, Zabbly has acquired a dedicated address MAC range from IEEE specifically for use by LXC and Incus, `10:66:6a`.

  The new range will automatically be used for all new instances and networks.
  Existing instances and networks remain unchanged.

  ## USB NICs in VMs
  A new `io.bus` configuration key has been added to network interfaces in VMs.
  This supports two values, `virtio` (default) and `usb`.

  When setting `io.bus=usb`, the network interface will show up as a generic USB network adapter rather than the usual PCI device.

  This should help with getting some older guest OS get networking as well as help newer ones get online to fetch the virtio drivers before switching the NIC back to its default `virtio` bus.

  Documentation: https://linuxcontainers.org/incus/docs/main/reference/devices_nic/

  ## USB disks in VMs
  It's also now possible to attach disks to VMs through the USB bus.
  When doing that, those disks show up as generic USB mass storage devices.

  This is done by setting `io.bus=usb` on the disk device.

  Documentation: https://linuxcontainers.org/incus/docs/main/reference/devices_disk/

  ## Tracking of VM machine definition
  Incus now tracks what the exact QEMU machine definition is during startup, allowing for live-migration between QEMU versions so long as the target is on the same QEMU release or newer.

  This is done through a new `volatile.vm.definition` configuration key.

  ## Configurable OCI entrypoint
  It's now possible to configure the entry point for OCI containers.

  On container creation, the entry point data is extracted from the OCI configuration and turned into editable configuration on the container.

  This is done through four new configuration options:

   - `oci.entrypoint`
   - `oci.cwd`
   - `oci.uid`
   - `oci.gid`

  Those can be overriden during instance creation or changed at will afterwards.

      stgraber@castiana:~$ incus launch oci-docker:nginx nginx
      Launching nginx
      stgraber@castiana:~$ incus config show nginx | grep oci\\.
        oci.cwd: /
        oci.entrypoint: /docker-entrypoint.sh nginx -g 'daemon off;'
        oci.gid: "0"
        oci.uid: "0"

  Documentation: https://linuxcontainers.org/incus/docs/main/reference/instance_options/

  ## Unprivileged ICMP (ping) in OCI containers
  OCI containers are now able to send ICMP packets as regular users.
  This is allowed as application containers are designed to run a single application and so don't really benefit from having this be restricted to the root user.

  ## Unprivileged low ports in OCI containers
  OCI containers are now able to bind low ports as regular users.
  This is allowed as application containers are designed to run a single application and so don't really benefit from having this be restricted to the root user.

  ## Allocated CPU time in instance state API
  A new `allocated_time` value is exposed as part of the CPU instance state information.
  It's used is to report how much CPU time (in nanoseconds) could be consumed per second, should the container be using as much as it's allowed.

  This effectively allows calculating a percentage of CPU usage for a container when combined with multiple CPU usage datapoints over a known period of time.

      stgraber@castiana:~$ incus query /1.0/instances/nginx/state | jq .cpu
      {
        "allocated_time": 1000000000,
        "usage": 163062000
      }

  ## Configurable DNS servers
  A new `dns.nameservers` configuration option is now available on both `bridge` and `ovn` networks. It takes a comma separated list of DNS servers to use rather than the default one.

  This can be useful when running a dedicated set of DNS resolvers that should be used directly by all instances, or for environments where you want specific networks to bypass all local resolving and go to public resolvers instead.

  Documentation (bridge): https://linuxcontainers.org/incus/docs/main/reference/network_bridge/
  Documentation (OVN): https://linuxcontainers.org/incus/docs/main/reference/network_ovn/

  ## Extra IPv4 routes through DHCP
  A new `ipv4.dhcp.routes` configuration option is now available on both `bridge` and `ovn` networks. It allows advertising additional routes through DHCP.

  Documentation (bridge): https://linuxcontainers.org/incus/docs/main/reference/network_bridge/
  Documentation (OVN): https://linuxcontainers.org/incus/docs/main/reference/network_ovn/

  ## Configurable IPv4 DHCP lease expiry on OVN
  The `ipv4.dhcp.expiry` configuration option is now available to OVN networks too.
  This allows reducing or extending the default DHCP lease duration.

  Documentation: https://linuxcontainers.org/incus/docs/main/reference/network_ovn/

  ## OVN logical switch name now part of network state
  The OVN logical switch name is now reported as part of the OVN network information.
  This can make debugging a fair bit easier, especially for networks that are isolated (no uplinks) and so may be lacking a logical router.

      root@server01:~# incus network info default
      Name: default
      MAC address: 00:16:3e:54:62:a9
      MTU: 1500
      State: up
      Type: broadcast
      
      IP addresses:
        inet	10.104.61.1/24 (link)
        inet6	fd42:73ae:9013:c530::1/64 (link)
      
      OVN:
        Chassis: server01
        Logical router: incus-net20-lr
        Logical switch: incus-net20-ls-int
        IPv4 uplink address: 172.31.254.10
        IPv6 uplink address: fd00:1e4d:637d:1234:216:3eff:fe54:62a9

  # Notice for packagers
  With this release Incus now uses the `lego` tool externally for ACME handling.
  This is to significantly reduce the size of the Incus binary itself, but means that `lego` should be added as a dependency.
