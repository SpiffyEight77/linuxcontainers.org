  # Introduction
  Happy new year!

  The Incus team is pleased to announce the release of Incus 6.9!

  This is a bit of a lighter release given the holiday break, but it features some nice feature additions on top of the usual health dose of bugfixes.

  [![image|690x429](https://discuss.linuxcontainers.org/uploads/default/original/2X/7/7695a246163a1b6b5e964db33c34223fd9d8a2e9.png)](https://linuxcontainers.org/incus/try-it/)

  As usual, you can try it for yourself online: https://linuxcontainers.org/incus/try-it/

  Enjoy!

  # New features
  ## Instance network ACL on bridge networks
  Network ACLs can now be directly applied to instances running on a managed network bridge, so long as the system is using `nft` for its firewalling (can be checked with `incus info`).

  This allows for networking micro-segmentation by having various instances running on the same bridged network having individual ingress/egress firewall rules applied to them.

  Network ACLs can be created and managed through `incus network acl` and then applied to the relevant NIC interfaces using the `security.acls` configuration key.

  ACL documentation: https://linuxcontainers.org/incus/docs/main/howto/network_acls/
  Bridge documentation: https://linuxcontainers.org/incus/docs/main/reference/network_bridge/
  NIC documentation: https://linuxcontainers.org/incus/docs/main/reference/devices_nic/#nic-bridged

  ## Enhancements to QEMU scriptlet
  The QEMU scriptlet has been further improved in this release.

  All scriptlet calls now provide the full instance structure, offering access to the instance configuration, list of profiles, ...

  A new `config` hook was also added which runs prior to QEMU being started at all.
  This hook cannot be used to send QMP commands, but it allows calling new functions to alter the QEMU configuration file or command line arguments:

   - `get_qemu_cmdline`
   - `set_qemu_cmdline`
   - `get_qemu_conf`
   - `set_qemu_conf`

  Documentation: https://linuxcontainers.org/incus/docs/main/reference/instance_options/#advanced-use

  ## VM memory dumps
  A new `incus debug memory-dump` command and matching API has been added to provide an easy way to get a virtual machine memory dump.

  Incus VMs also now include the necessary additional device to allow for Windows virtual machines to provide memory debug information allowing for a memory dump that can be loaded in the Windows debugger.

      stgraber@dakara:~$ incus launch images:debian/12 v1 --vm
      Launching v1
      stgraber@dakara:~$ incus debug dump-memory v1 debug --format=elf
      stgraber@dakara:~$ file debug
      debug: ELF 64-bit LSB core file, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), SVR4-style

  ## Uplink addresses in OVN network state
  It's now possible to get the uplink IPv4 and IPv6 addresses directly from `incus network info`.

      stgraber@athos:~# incus network info default
      Name: default
      MAC address: 00:16:3e:8d:51:b6
      MTU: 1500
      State: up
      Type: broadcast
      
      IP addresses:
        inet   10.22.45.1/24 (link)
        inet6  2602:fc62:b:8006::1/64 (link)
      
      Network usage:
        Bytes received: 0B
        Bytes sent: 0B
        Packets received: 0
        Packets sent: 0
      
      OVN:
        Chassis: delmak
        Logical router: incus-net13-lr
        IPv4 uplink address: 172.17.200.106
        IPv6 uplink address: 2602:fc62:b:200::106

  ## Creation of storage volumes through server preseed file
  It's now possible to define some initial storage volumes directly through the server preseed file.
  This can be useful to set up some shared volumes to be used by a profile that's also part of the preseed, or as a way to define volumes to be used for Incus images or backups storage.

  Documentation: https://linuxcontainers.org/incus/docs/main/howto/initialize/#configuration-format

  ## Setting description in `create` commands
  All `create` commands now have a `--description` option which can be used to directly set the description field on the object.

      stgraber@dakara:~$ incus profile create foo --description "Example profile"
      Profile foo created
      stgraber@dakara:~$ incus profile list
      +---------+-----------------------+---------+
      |  NAME   |      DESCRIPTION      | USED BY |
      +---------+-----------------------+---------+
      | default | Default Incus profile | 6       |
      +---------+-----------------------+---------+
      | foo     | Example profile       | 0       |
      +---------+-----------------------+---------+
